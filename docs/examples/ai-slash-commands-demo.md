### 7. Using "Change Tone: Casual" (😊)

Make it more conversational:

```
# AI is Totally Changing How We Work

So here's the thing - AI is basically taking over all the boring stuff at work. You know those repetitive tasks that make you want to pull your hair out? Yeah, AI's got those covered now.

The cool part is that machine learning can crunch through tons of data super fast. Like, stuff that would take you weeks to figure out, AI does in seconds. Pretty wild, right?

We're seeing AI pop up everywhere - customer service bots, tools that predict what's gonna happen next, you name it. And it's not just one industry - healthcare, finance, schools, everyone's getting in on it.

The key thing to remember? AI isn't here to steal your job. It's more like a really smart coworker. Learn to work with it, and you'll be golden.
```

### 8. Using "Add Summary" (📋)

Add a TL;DR at the top:

```
**Summary**: AI is transforming workplaces by automating routine tasks and providing rapid data analysis, enabling professionals to focus on creative and strategic work while learning to collaborate with intelligent systems across all industries.

[Original content follows...]
```

### 9. Using "Create Outline" (📑)

Structure the content:

```
