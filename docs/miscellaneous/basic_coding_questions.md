All test cases contain valid one word strings.
Program 126
Create a function that takes a string and returns True or False, depending on whether
the characters are in order or not.
Examples
is_in_order("abc") ➞ True
is_in_order("edabit") ➞ False
is_in_order("123") ➞ True
is_in_order("xyzz") ➞ True
You don't have to handle empty strings.
Program 127
Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns True or False
depending on whether the number is symmetrical or not. A number is symmetrical
when it is the same as its reverse.
Examples
is_symmetrical(7227) ➞ True
is_symmetrical(12567) ➞ False
is_symmetrical(44444444) ➞ True
is_symmetrical(9939) ➞ False
is_symmetrical(1112111) ➞ True
Program 128
Given a string of numbers separated by a comma and space, return the product of
the numbers.
Examples
multiply_nums("2, 3") ➞ 6
multiply_nums("1, 2, 3, 4") ➞ 24
multiply_nums("54, 75, 453, 0") ➞ 0
multiply_nums("10, -2") ➞ -20
Program 129
Create a function that squares every digit of a number.
Examples
square_digits(9119) ➞ 811181
square_digits(2483) ➞ 416649
square_digits(3212) ➞ 9414
Notes
The function receives an integer and must return an integer.
Program 130
Create a function that sorts a list and removes all duplicate items from it.
Examples
setify([1, 3, 3, 5, 5]) ➞ [1, 3, 5]
setify([4, 4, 4, 4]) ➞ [4]
setify([5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]) ➞ [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]
setify([3, 3, 3, 2, 1]) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
Program 131
Create a function that returns the mean of all digits.
Examples
mean(42) ➞ 3
mean(12345) ➞ 3
mean(666) ➞ 6
Notes
The mean of all digits is the sum of digits / how many digits there are (e.g. mean
of digits in 512 is (5+1+2)/3(number of digits) = 8/3=2).
The mean will always be an integer.
Program 132
Create a function that takes an integer and returns a list from 1 to the given number,
where:
1. If the number can be divided evenly by 4, amplify it by 10 (i.e. return 10 times the
number).
2. If the number cannot be divided evenly by 4, simply return the number.
Examples
amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]
amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160, 17, 18, 19, 200, 21,
22, 23, 240, 25]
Notes
The given integer will always be equal to or greater than 1.
Include the number (see example above).
To perform this problem with its intended purpose, try doing it with list
comprehensions. If that's too difficult, just solve the challenge any way you can.
Program 133
Create a function that takes a list of numbers and return the number that's unique.
Examples
unique([3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3]) ➞ 7
unique([0, 0, 0.77, 0, 0]) ➞ 0.77
unique([0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]) ➞ 0
Notes
Test cases will always have exactly one unique number while all others are the same.
Program 134
Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided
by an argument. The circles constructed must have two getters getArea() (PIr^2) and
getPerimeter() (2PI*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter
(circumference).
For help with this class, I have provided you with a Rectangle constructor which you
can use as a base example.
Examples
circy = Circle(11)
circy.getArea()
Should return 380.132711084365
circy = Circle(4.44)
circy.getPerimeter()
Should return 27.897342763877365
Notes
Round results up to the nearest integer.
Program 135
Create a function that takes a list of strings and return a list, sorted from shortest to
longest.
Examples
sort_by_length(["Google", "Apple", "Microsoft"]) ➞ ["Apple", "Google", "Microsoft"]
sort_by_length(["Leonardo", "Michelangelo", "Raphael", "Donatello"]) ➞ ["Raphael",
"Leonardo", "Donatello", "Michelangelo"]
sort_by_length(["Turing", "Einstein", "Jung"]) ➞ ["Jung", "Turing", "Einstein"]
Notes
All test cases contain lists with strings of different lengths, so you won't have to deal.
Program 136
Create a function that validates whether three given integers form a Pythagorean
triplet. The sum of the squares of the two smallest integers must equal the square of
the largest number to be validated.
Examples
is_triplet(3, 4, 5) ➞ True
3² + 4² = 25
5² = 25
is_triplet(13, 5, 12) ➞ True
5² + 12² = 169
13² = 169
is_triplet(1, 2, 3) ➞ False
1² + 2² = 5
3² = 9
Notes
Numbers may not be given in a sorted order.
Program 137
Create a function that takes three integer arguments (a, b, c) and returns the amount
of integers which are of equal value.
Examples
equal(3, 4, 3) ➞ 2
equal(1, 1, 1) ➞ 3
equal(3, 4, 1) ➞ 0
Notes
Your function must return 0, 2 or 3Program 138
Write a function that converts a dictionary into a list of keys-values tuples.
Examples
dict_to_list({
"D": 1,
"B": 2
"C": 3
}) ➞ [("B", 2), ("C", 3), ("D", 1)]
dict_to_list({
"likes": 2,
"dislikes": 3,
"followers": 10
}) ➞ [("dislikes", 3), ("followers", 10), ("likes", 2)]
Notes
Return the elements in the list in alphabetical order.
Program 139
Write a function that creates a dictionary with each (key, value) pair being the (lower
case, upper case) versions of a letter, respectively.
Examples
mapping(["p", "s"]) ➞ { "p": "P", "s": "S" }
mapping(["a", "b", "c"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "b": "B", "c": "C" }
mapping(["a", "v", "y", "z"]) ➞ { "a": "A", "v": "V", "y": "Y", "z": "Z" }
Notes
All of the letters in the input list will always be lowercase.
Program 140
Write a function, that replaces all vowels in a string with a specified vowel.
Examples
vow_replace("apples and bananas", "u") ➞ "upplus und bununus"
vow_replace("cheese casserole", "o") ➞ "chooso cossorolo"
vow_replace("stuffed jalapeno poppers", "e") ➞ "steffed jelepene peppers"
Notes
All words will be lowercase. Y is not considered a vowel.
Program 141
Create a function that takes a string as input and capitalizes a letter if its ASCII code
is even and returns its lower case version if its ASCII code is odd.
Examples
ascii_capitalize("to be or not to be!") ➞ "To Be oR NoT To Be!"
ascii_capitalize("THE LITTLE MERMAID") ➞ "THe LiTTLe meRmaiD"
ascii_capitalize("Oh what a beautiful morning.") ➞ "oH wHaT a BeauTiFuL
moRNiNg."
